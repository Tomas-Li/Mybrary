The account system is for "employees" of the store. What I try to say with this is that you can't create an account, the only ones who can do this are accounts with the level of owner or manager. If you are interested in trying the full application:
- Send me an email for an account to add/modify/delete books and for adding more accounts and testing the verification through token payload process.
- Mount you own local version of the application
